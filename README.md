# book-codes--hands-on-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn-and-TensorFlow
This repository contains my test codes and exercises from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.

Each chapter's code is organized in its respective folder, and includes Jupyter Notebooks, scripts, and other materials relevant to the book.
